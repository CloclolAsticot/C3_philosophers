Here's what the philosopher routine function should do conceptually:

Main Purpose:
The routine function represents the "life" of a single philosopher - it's what each philosopher thread will execute continuously.

Core Activities (The Dining Philosophers Cycle):

1. Thinking Phase:
The philosopher spends time thinking
This is a non-blocking activity that doesn't require any resources
Should include some time delay to simulate thinking time

2. Getting Hungry:
The philosopher decides they want to eat
They need to acquire two forks (left and right) to eat
This is the critical section where deadlock can occur

3. Fork Acquisition:
Try to pick up the left fork (lock left mutex)
Try to pick up the right fork (lock right mutex)
Must handle the case where forks aren't available
Should print status messages when acquiring forks

4. Eating Phase:
Once both forks are acquired, the philosopher can eat
Spend time eating (use the time_to_eat parameter)
Update last meal time (important for death detection)
Increment meal counter if there's a meal limit

5. Fork Release:
Release the right fork (unlock right mutex)
Release the left fork (unlock left mutex)
Allow other philosophers to use these forks

6. Sleeping Phase:
After eating, the philosopher sleeps
Use the time_to_sleep parameter for duration
This is another non-blocking activity

7. Loop Control:
Check if the philosopher should stop (death occurred, meal limit reached)
Check global simulation state
Continue the cycle if simulation is still running

Key Responsibilities:
Resource management: Properly acquire and release forks
Time tracking: Monitor when last meal occurred
Status reporting: Print what the philosopher is doing
Termination detection: Know when to exit the loop
Thread safety: Use mutexes for all shared resource access
Exit Conditions:
Another philosopher died
This philosopher reached the required number of meals
Simulation time limit reached
Error condition occurred
The routine essentially simulates a philosopher's life cycle in an infinite loop until a termination condition is met.
